    <p>Some of these are described below:</p>
    <p>She is an author of over 150 papers in computer science, including two US patents, which are well-cited (h-index > 30) and supervised ten doctoral dissertations. Most recently she has been writing technology articles for the general public, e.g., internet of everything, personalized marketing, etc.</p>
    <p>Since 1997, I have been actively working in information extraction (IE), a discipline that is at the intersection of linguistics and computer science. IE concerns the ability to extract salient information such as entities, relationships between entities, and events from large collections of unstructured text. I have been involved in applications of IE including question-answering-- focusing on a hybrid approach to IE that combines statistical machine learning with grammar and lexicon-based approaches. The Semantex text mining platform is the culmination of over a decade of funded research in this area and has led to numerous publications and invited talks. It is being used by both government and industry in a variety of text-processing applications. The recent focus has been on using semi-supervised learning in order to facilitate domain porting. Special topics I have been pursuing include temporal and location normalization, massive scalability, entity/name disambuiguation, and processing of noisy text such as chat and blog data.</p>
