The course begins with some fundamentals on data mining followed by recommender systems (algorithms powering Amazon, Facebook and Twitter). This is followed by a discussion of several topics in content mining, including entity tagging, topic models, and information extraction. The last segment focuses on graph mining techniques suitable for analyzing social networks. Lectures will include case studies of successfully implemented solutions. "
